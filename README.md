# Poster Frontend

A simple React frontend that displays a poster with a title, description, image, and a submit button. The data is currently hardcoded but can later be fetched from a backend.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be served from `public/index.html`.
